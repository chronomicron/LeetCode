# LeetCode Solutions Repository

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems, implemented in C++ and organized into three folders based on difficulty: `Easy`, `Medium`, and `Hard`. Each problemâ€™s solution includes a `main()` function that injects LeetCode test cases, enabling easy execution and verification in Visual Studio Code on an Ubuntu Linux environment.

## Structure
- **Easy/**: Solutions to LeetCode problems classified as Easy.
- **Medium/**: Solutions to LeetCode problems classified as Medium.
- **Hard/**: Solutions to LeetCode problems classified as Hard.

Each solution file (`.cpp`) contains:
- The LeetCode problem description in a header comment.
- The solution code within a `Solution` class.
- A `main()` function that runs predefined test cases and prints results.

## Running the Solutions
- **Environment**: Ubuntu Linux, using Visual Studio Code.
- **Compile**: Use `g++` (e.g., `g++ Easy/two_sum.cpp -o Easy/two_sum`).
- **Run**: Execute the binary (e.g., `./Easy/two_sum`) to see test case outputs.
- **Git**: Executables are ignored via `.gitignore` to keep the repository clean.
